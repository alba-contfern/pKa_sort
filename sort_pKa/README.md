The objective of creating this package was to have a program able to sort given molecules from least to most acid. This is useful in first year organic chemistry, for example to verify one's exercise answers or, thanks to the pKa values given, compare the difference of acidity between them. 



To use this package, the PubChemPy package will need to be installed, as well as rdkit, pandas and request
